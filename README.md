# Assignment 2

1. Reverse the order of elements on stack S
    - a. using two additional stacks
    - b. using one additional queue
    - c. using one additional stack and some additional nonarray variables
    
2. Put the elements on the stack S in ascending order using one additional stack and
some additional nonarray variables.

3. Transfer elements from stack S1 to stack S2 so that the elements from S2 are in the
same order as on S1
    - a. using one additional stack
    - b. using no additional stack but only some additional nonarray variables
    - 4. Suggest an implementation of a stack to hold elements of two different types, such
