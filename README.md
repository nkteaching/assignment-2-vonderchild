- 1. Reverse the order of elements on stack S
    - a. using two additional stacks
    - b. using one additional queue
    - c. using one additional stack and some additional nonarray variables.     
    >[solution](https://github.com/nkteaching/assignment-2-vonderchild/blob/master/chapter4/question1.cpp)
    
- 2. Put the elements on the stack S in ascending order using one additional stack and
some additional nonarray variables.

- 3. Transfer elements from stack S1 to stack S2 so that the elements from S2 are in the
same order as on S1
    - a. using one additional stack
    - b. using no additional stack but only some additional nonarray variables

- 7. Define a stack in terms of a queue; that is, create a class

### Programming Assignments

- 1. Write a program that determines whether an input string is a palindrome; that is,
whether it can be read the same way forward and backward. At each point, you can
read only one character of the input string; do not use an array to first store this
string and then analyze it (except, possibly, in a stack implementation). Consider
using multiple stacks.

- 3. Write a program that implements the algorithm delimiterMatching() from
Section 4.1.

- 4. Write a program that implements the algorithm addingLargeNumbers() from
Section 4.1.

## [Chapter 5](https://github.com/nkteaching/assignment-2-vonderchild/tree/master/chapter5)

- 2. Write a recursive function that calculates and returns the length of a linked list.

- 5. Write a recursive method that for a positive integer n prints odd numbers
    - a. between 1 and n
    - b. between n and 1

- 6. Write a recursive method that for a positive integer returns a string with commas
in the appropriate places, for example, putCommas(1234567) returns the string
“1,234,567.”

- 8. Write a recursive method that uses only addition, subtraction, and comparison to
multiply two numbers.

- 10. Write a recursive function to add the first n terms of the series 
1 + 1/2 - 1/3 + 1/4 - 1/5...

- 12. Give a recursive version of the following function:
    ```
    void cubes(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    cout << i * i * i << ’’;
    }
    ```
 
- 16. Check recursively if the following objects are palindromes:
    - a. a word
    - b. a sentence (ignoring blanks, lower- and uppercase differences, and punctuation
marks so that “Madam, I’m Adam” is accepted as a palindrome)

- 17. For a given character recursively, without using strchr() or strrchr(),
    - a. Check if it is in a string.
    - b. Count all of its occurrences in a string.
    - c. Remove all of its occurrences from a string.

- 29. Write the shortest program you can that uses recursion.
